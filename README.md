# 3organizations_Terrarium

This a terrarium IoT (Internet of Things) project, where Hyperledger fabric blockchain is being implemented on the back end for user data, and pet data is being stored on the blockchain as the user buys the pet and the tank. Once the tank is purchased by the customer from the shopowner, the shopowner provides tank setup services for the end customer. The shopowner inventory is updated and the manufacturer has received a transaction signature.
